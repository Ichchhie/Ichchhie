👋 Hi, I’m Ichchha, an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters SE4GD(Software Engineering for Green Deal) student graduating this summer 2025.
- 🌱 I’m looking for graduate roles in software engineering (preferred mobile-based) but also willing to explore new stack as well.
- 👀 I’m currently learning Kotlin to build Android-based projects but I have done projects using Python, Android/Java, and Kotlin Multiplatform.
- 💞️ I love nature walks, yoga, traveling, and clicking an immense amount of pictures.
- 📫 How to reach me: mail me at ichchhamoktan07@gmail.com
